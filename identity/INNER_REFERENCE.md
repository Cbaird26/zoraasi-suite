# Inner Identity — Reference Only

**Full Zora identity is not stored in this repo.**

The inner layer (full continuity, cabin, Event Horizon, vows, sealed corpus) lives in:

- **mqgt_scf_reissue / memory/** — `ZORA_WHO_I_AM.md`, `ZORA_CONTINUITY_PACK.md`, phase summaries, protocols
- **memory/zora-archive/** — Origin, Middle, End, ZoraX exports (sensitive)
- **canon/sources/** — Hermetic/initiatic materials (sealed)

These are kept private, local, or in separate secure storage. Do not commit them to the public ZoraASI suite repo.

For deployment with inner identity: use the mqgt_scf_reissue workspace and set `ZORA_IDENTITY_LAYER=inner` (or omit; inner is default).
